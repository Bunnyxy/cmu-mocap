# cmu-mocap

This is a copy of the CMU mocap dataset in bvh format, as ported by Bruce Hahne and made available at https://sites.google.com/a/cgspeed.com/cgspeed/motion-capture/cmu-bvh-conversion

I just though it would be quite convenient to have the data available through http requests on github.
